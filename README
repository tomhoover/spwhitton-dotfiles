This is Sean Whitton's dotfiles.  I try to make it clear when stuff
was written by me, and when it was taken from elsewhere.  Stuff I've
written is GPL v3 or any later versions published by the FSF.

The master branch should work on most hosts, and host-specific
configurations for host `host.domain' live in the branch `host'.  All
such host branches have master as their parent and are rebased onto
master: the only exception is some branches based on `win32' for
specific Windows hosts.

This restriction is to make usage less complex, even if it results in
some patches being duplicated between multiple host branches (that
aren't suitable for master).  My dotfiles are too important for the
repository to require time-consuming, complex rebase operations.  In
particular, the restriction allows for the `mr update' and `mr rebase'
commands to be simple scripts that almost always do exactly what's
needed.

# To use this, find flagged thread in a notmuch search, use `c i` to
# invoke `notmuch-search-stash-thread-id`.  Then go to an Org-mode doc
# and use this snippet to insert a link that will go to the thread
# with only starred messages expanded for view.
#
# The purpose of this is for cases where there are multiple actionable
# messages in a single thread, such that I want to view them all in a
# single buffer.  I flag those, and create a link to the thread using
# this snippet.  Creating Org links to individual messages would not
# achieve this.  And having an 'inbox' tag which represents actionable
# but read messages would add overhead as I'd have to get used to
# removing that tag from messages, and sort out syncing the tag.  The
# case comes up too rarely for it to be worth doing that.

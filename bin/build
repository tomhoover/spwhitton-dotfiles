# The purpose of this script is to give the right magic invocation to
# build a Debian package, the traditional way, without using sbuild
# and friends.  It could later be extended to build other things.

# The main motivation for having the script is to deal with the fact
# that some repositories are committed to with quilt patches applied,
# and some are committed with quilt patches unapplied.  This script
# should make that transparent, without using the
# d/source/local-options file, which interferes with dgit.

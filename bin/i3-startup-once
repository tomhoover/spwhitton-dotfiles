# ---- screen locking

# Due to the ways the X root window and i3lock work, if we use
# wallpaper then we have to resize it, set the root window and restart
# i3lock each time an external monitor is added or removed.  That
# requires some serious logic and probably isn't worth it.  Since I
# plug and unplug my laptop from an external monitor a lot, just use
# solid colour for now.  Could easily add some commits to set a
# background and lockscreen on the dotfiles branches of machines that
# have only one monitor

# kill any other lockers that might have snuck in
pkill -u $USER light-locker
pkill -u $USER xscreensaver

# turn over lid switch handling to logind, if needed
if which xfconf-query; then

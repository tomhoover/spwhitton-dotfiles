Hello,

Thank you for meeting up and for the opportunity to exchange PGP
signatures.

Please find attached the user id{(scalar @uids >= 2 ? 's' : '')}
{foreach $uid (@uids) {
    $OUT .= "\t".$uid."\n";
};}of your key {$key} signed by me.

If you have multiple user ids, I sent the signature for each user id
separately to that user id's associated email address. You can import
the signatures by running each through `gpg --import`.  This is a
means by which I verify control of the e-mail addresses you claim to
control.

Note that I did not upload your key to any keyservers. If you want this
new signature to be available to others, please upload it yourself.
With GnuPG this can be done using
	gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --send-key {$key}

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Regards,
